## 📜 Description:
Developed an Intrusion Detection System which can detect Intruders. It also makes an Alarm sound when detected to sound or warn the authorities or nearby individuals. Ideal to be used along with CCTVs for wide area Surveillance purposes.

## 🌳 Social-Welfare Usecase:
The Social-Welface usecase of this intrusion detection system (IDS) is that it monitors a network for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported or collected centrally using a security information and event management system. An IDS can be used to help analyze the quantity and types of attacks, and organizations can use this information to change their security systems or implement more effective controls.


## 🏗 Built With:
 - Playsound. 
 - Numpy Library.
 - OpenCV Library.
